# Changelog

## [1.0.0.3] - 2026-06-11

### Release Highlights

- Prepared the next public release after the `v1.0.0.2` compliance pass.
- Rebuilt and verified the SpatiaLite runtime package metadata, including `built_at_utc`, `build_tool`, and per-file SHA-256/byte checks.
- Kept `sqlite3.exe`, `libreadline8.dll`, and `libtermcap-0.dll` out of the packaged runtime to avoid shipping the unused Readline-linked SQLite shell.
- Added smoke-test coverage for the committed SpatiaLite runtime manifest so stale hashes or blocked files are caught before release.

### Updates And Packaging

- Added portable ZIP update support that can download a GitHub Release asset, verify it with `release-manifest.json`, generate an apply script, replace the current app after exit, and restart `mySQLPunk.exe`.
- Hardened GitHub Release packaging with bundled root notices, image asset notices, native runtime notices, and NuGet license/notice files, including the Oracle Managed Data Access license.
- Improved release manifest verification for portable update assets and SpatiaLite native runtime files.
- Updated the release workflow so GitHub Release notes can be generated from this changelog instead of a placeholder body.

### Database And UI Improvements

- Added the option to hide database object groups, allowing Tables, Views, Functions, Users, Events, and Queries to appear directly under each database node.
- Improved View/Table copy and provider SQL fallback messages so unsupported or failed conversions explain the reason more consistently.
- Localized many UI, diagnostics, backup, import/export, provider, metadata, SpatiaLite, update, proxy, registration, and error fallback messages in Traditional Chinese and English.
- Normalized empty or missing exception reasons to localized unknown-error messages instead of blank dialogs.

### Notes

- This release focuses on packaging, update flow, localization, diagnostics, and third-party notice cleanup.
- The existing `v1.0.0.2` GitHub Release does not include these changes; publish this release with tag `v1.0.0.3`.
- Installer-based updates are still a future enhancement; the current release asset is the portable ZIP plus `release-manifest.json`.
